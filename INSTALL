logkeys keylogger - installation instructions
=============================================

Provided your GNU/Linux distribution doesn't include logkeys package
in its repositories, manual installation of logkeys from source is as
easy as cloning this repo or [downloading a zip of the
source](https://github.com/kernc/logkeys/archive/master.zip),
unzipping, configuring, and building.

Prerequisites
-------------

You need some tools to build the code from source:

    # On Debian-based distros
    sudo apt-get update
    sudo apt-get install autotools-dev autoconf
    
    # On openSUSE
    zypper install automake
    zypper install gcc-c++
    
    # on Fedora/Redhat/CentOS
    dnf install automake
    dnf install gcc make gcc-c++
    

Build and Install
-----------------

    $ unzip logkeys-master.zip     # or use git clone
    $ cd logkeys-master

    $ ./autogen.sh     # generate files for build
    $ cd build         # keeps the root and src dirs clean
    $ ../configure

    $ make
    $ su               # get root to install in system
    $ make install     # installs binaries, manuals and scripts

To uninstall logkeys, remove accompanying scripts and manuals:

    $ make uninstall    # in the same build dir

See README file for usage instructions, troubleshooting and other notes.

Cleaning after a build
----------------------

`autogen.sh` and `configure` generate many files which are ignored by
git.  All of these files can be removed from the project, e.g. to
force a clean build, with the following:

    git clean -xdf
